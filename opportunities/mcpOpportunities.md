### MCP + AWS + Journey Ahead

- AWS now provides guidance for securely running MCP servers on the cloud using containerized architecture with OAuth 2.0 authentication Guidance for Deploying Model Context Protocol Servers on AWS. This creates a massive opportunity for SaaS ERP providers.

- AI Agents (GBPAs) for ERP systems that can integrate structured and unstructured data in real time using MCPs. Clients could have AI agents that understand their entire financial ecosystem. Deploy MCP servers that give your ERP AI real-time access to market data, regulatory changes, bank feeds, and third-party financial services.

#### Phase 1: Core MCP Integration

Deploy secure MCP servers on AWS for each client
Connect to their existing data sources (banks, payment processors, regulatory databases)
Enable AI assistants to query and act on financial data in real-time

#### Phase 2: Intelligent Automation
Automate reconciliation, compliance reporting, and anomaly detection
Provide contextual financial insights and recommendations


#### Phase 3: Cross-System Intelligence
Deploy MCP servers that connect multiple business systems, enabling AI agents to understand the complete business context - not just isolated financial data.



#### Hidden Revenue Opportunities
MCP-as-a-Service: Charge premium for AI-enabled ERP with continuous learning capabilities
Industry-Specific AI Agents: Develop specialized MCP servers for different finance verticals
Predictive Analytics: AI agents that provide forward-looking business insights



### RAG vs MCP 

vs. MCP: While MCP standardizes tool connections, Agentic RAG focuses on intelligent document retrieval and knowledge synthesis.


### AI agent architecture

Right now, three major approaches are competing to define the future of AI agent architecture:

Function Calling: OpenAI's pioneering approach — teaching LLMs to make API calls like junior developers

MCP (Model Context Protocol): Anthropic’s attempt to create a standard toolkit interface across models and services.

A2A (Agent-to-Agent Protocol): Google’s brand-new spec for letting different Agents talk to each other and work as a team.
